5,"Multiple imputation is increasingly used in dealing with missing data. While some conventional multiple imputation approaches are well studied and have shown empirical validity, they entail limitations in processing large datasets with complex data structures. Their imputation performances usually rely on expert knowledge of the inherent relations among variables. In addition, these standard approaches tend to be computationally inefficient for medium and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a scalable multiple imputation framework mixgb, which is based on XGBoost, bootstrapping and predictive mean matching. XGBoost, one of the fastest implementations of gradient boosted trees, is able to automatically retain interactions and non-linear relations in a dataset while achieving high computational efficiency. With the aid of bootstrapping and predictive mean matching, we show that our approach obtains less biased estimates and reflects appropriate imputation variability. The proposed framework is implemented in an R package misle. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",1

8,"Learning with neural networks relies on the complexity of the representable functions, but more importantly, the particular assignment of typical parameters to functions of different complexity. Taking the number of activation regions as a complexity measure, recent works have shown that the practical complexity of deep ReLU networks is often far from the theoretical maximum. In this work we show that this phenomenon also occurs in networks with maxout (multi-argument) activation functions and when considering the decision boundaries in classification tasks. We also show that the parameter space has a multitude of full-dimensional regions with widely different complexity, and obtain nontrivial lower bounds on the expected complexity. Finally, we investigate different parameter initialization procedures and show that they can increase the speed of convergence in training. ",1

11," We consider the problem of model selection for the general stochastic contextual bandits under the realizability assumption. We propose a successive refinement based algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Bandit ({\ttfamily ACB}), that works in phases and successively eliminates model classes that are too simple to fit the given instance. We prove that this algorithm is adaptive, i.e., the regret rate order-wise matches that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, the state-of-art contextual bandit algorithm of Levi et. al '20, that needs knowledge of the true model class. The price of not knowing the correct model class is only an additive term contributing to the second order term in the regret bound. This cost possess the intuitive property that it becomes smaller as the model class becomes easier to identify, and vice-versa. We then show that a much simpler explore-then-commit (ETC) style algorithm also obtains a regret rate of matching that of {\ttfamily FALCON}, despite not knowing the true model class. However, the cost of model selection is higher in ETC as opposed to in {\ttfamily ACB}, as expected. Furthermore, {\ttfamily ACB} applied to the linear bandit setting with unknown sparsity, order-wise recovers the model selection guarantees previously established by algorithms tailored to the linear setting.

12,"Recent works have revealed that infinitely-wide feed-forward or recurrent neural networks of any architecture correspond to Gaussian processes referred to as NNGP. While these works have extended the class of neural networks converging to Gaussian processes significantly, however, there has been little focus on broadening the class of stochastic processes that such neural networks converge to. In this work, inspired by the scale mixture of Gaussian random variables, we propose the scale mixture of NNGP for which we introduce a prior distribution on the scale of the last-layer parameters. We show that simply introducing a scale prior on the last-layer parameters can turn infinitely-wide neural networks of any architecture into a richer class of stochastic processes. Especially, with certain scale priors, we obtain heavy-tailed stochastic processes, and we recover Student's t processes in the case of inverse gamma priors. We further analyze the distributions of the neural networks initialized with our prior setting and trained with gradient descents and obtain similar results as for NNGP. We present a practical posterior-inference algorithm for the scale mixture of NNGP and empirically demonstrate its usefulness on regression and classification tasks. ",1

15,"Detecting abrupt changes in temporal behavior patterns is of interest in many industrial and security applications. Abrupt changes are often local and observable primarily through a well-aligned sensing action (e.g., a camera with a narrow field-of-view). Due to resource constraints, continuous monitoring of all of the sensors is impractical. We propose the bandit quickest changepoint detection framework as a means of balancing sensing cost with detection delay. In this framework, sensing actions (or sensors) are sequentially chosen, and only measurements corresponding to chosen actions are observed. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the detection delay for a general class of finitely parameterized probability distributions. We then propose a computationally efficient online sensing scheme, which seamlessly balances the need for exploration of different sensing options with exploitation of querying informative actions. We derive expected delay bounds for the proposed scheme and show that these bounds match our information-theoretic lower bounds at low false alarm rates, establishing optimality of the proposed method. We then perform a number of experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method. ",1

Therefore we extend the Bayesian Optimization setting, which is tailored to maximization problems, to Min Max Optimization problems. While related work extends the two acquisition functions Expected Improvement and Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound; we extend the two acquisition functions Entropy Search and Knowledge Gradient. These acquisition functions are able to gain knowledge about the optimum instead of just looking for points that are supposed to be optimal. In our evaluation we show that these acquisition functions allow for better solutions - converging faster to the optimum than the benchmark settings. ",1

20,"In modern deep learning, there is a recent and growing literature on the interplay between large-width asymptotics for deep Gaussian neural networks (NNs), i.e. deep NNs with Gaussian-distributed weights, and classes of Gaussian stochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in several contexts of practical interest, e.g. Bayesian inference under Gaussian SP priors, kernel regression for infinite-wide deep NNs trained via gradient descent, and information propagation within infinite-wide NNs. Motivated by empirical analysis, showing the potential of replacing Gaussian distributions with Stable distributions for the NN's weights, in this paper we investigate large-width asymptotics for (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs, i.e. deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. First, we show that as the width goes to infinity jointly over the NN's layers, a suitable rescaled deep Stable NN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is characterized recursively through the NN's layers. Because of the non-triangular NN's structure, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem, to which we propose a novel and self-contained inductive approach, which may be of independent interest. Then, we establish sup-norm convergence rates of a deep Stable NN to a Stable SP, quantifying the critical difference between the settings of ``joint growth"" and ``sequential growth"" of the width over the NN's layers. Our work extends recent results on infinite-wide limits for deep Gaussian NNs to the more general deep Stable NNs, providing the first result on convergence rates for infinite-wide deep NNs. ",1
21,"We develop variational Laplace for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) which exploits a local approximation of the curvature of the likelihood to estimate the ELBO without the need for stochastic sampling of the neural-network weights. The Variational Laplace objective is simple to evaluate, as it is (in essence) the log-likelihood, plus weight-decay, plus a squared-gradient regularizer. Variational Laplace gave better test performance and expected calibration errors than maximum a-posteriori inference and standard sampling-based variational inference, despite using the same variational approximate posterior. Finally, we emphasise care needed in benchmarking standard VI as there is a risk of stopping before the variance parameters have converged. We show that early-stopping can be avoided by increasing the learning rate for the variance parameters. ",1

24,"Methods for building fair predictors often involve tradeoffs between fairness and accuracy and between different fairness criteria, but the nature of these tradeoffs varies. Recent work seeks to characterize these tradeoffs in specific problem settings, but these methods often do not accommodate users who wish to improve the fairness of an existing benchmark model without sacrificing accuracy, or vice versa. These results are also typically restricted to observable accuracy and fairness criteria. We develop a flexible framework for fair ensemble learning that allows users to efficiently explore the fairness-accuracy space or to improve the fairness or accuracy of a benchmark model. Our framework can simultaneously target multiple observable or counterfactual fairness criteria, and it enables users to combine a large number of previously trained and newly trained predictors. We provide theoretical guarantees that our estimators converge at fast rates. We apply our method on both simulated and real data, with respect to both observable and counterfactual accuracy and fairness criteria. We show that, surprisingly, multiple unfairness measures can sometimes be minimized simultaneously with little impact on accuracy, relative to unconstrained predictors or existing benchmark models.

While standard RF algorithms use bootstrap out-of-bag samples to compute out-of-bag scores, WW uses these samples to produce improved predictions given by an aggregation of the predictions of all possible subtrees of each fully grown tree in the forest. This is achieved by aggregation with exponential weights computed over out-of-bag samples, that are computed exactly and very efficiently thanks to an algorithm called context tree weighting. This improvement, combined with a histogram strategy to accelerate split finding, makes WW fast and competitive compared with other well-established ensemble methods, such as standard RF and extreme gradient boosting algorithms.

Experimental comparisons based on synthetic and UCI datasets show that our approach outperforms prior work in explained variance, fairness, and runtime. ",1

33,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are wide-spread machine learning tools for modeling sequential and time series data. They are notoriously hard to train because their loss gradients backpropagated in time tend to saturate or diverge during training. This is known as the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. Previous solutions to this issue either built on rather complicated, purpose-engineered architectures with gated memory buffers, or - more recently - imposed constraints that ensure convergence to a fixed point or restrict (the eigenspectrum of) the recurrence matrix. Such constraints, however, convey severe limitations on the expressivity of the RNN. Essential intrinsic dynamics such as multistability or chaos are disabled. This is inherently at disaccord with the chaotic nature of many, if not most, time series encountered in nature and society. Here we offer a comprehensive theoretical treatment of this problem by relating the loss gradients during RNN training to the Lyapunov spectrum of RNN-generated orbits. We mathematically prove that RNNs producing stable equilibrium or cyclic behavior have bounded gradients, whereas the gradients of RNNs with chaotic dynamics always diverge. Based on these analyses and insights, we offer an effective yet simple training technique for chaotic data and guidance on how to choose relevant hyperparameters according to the Lyapunov spectrum.

39,"We present a mathematical framework and computational methods to optimally design a finite number of sequential experiments. We formulate this sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) problem as a finite-horizon partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) in a Bayesian setting and with information-theoretic utilities. It is built to accommodate continuous random variables, general non-Gaussian posteriors, and expensive nonlinear forward models. sOED then seeks an optimal design policy that incorporates elements of both feedback and lookahead, generalizing the suboptimal batch and greedy designs. We solve for the sOED policy numerically via policy gradient (PG) methods from reinforcement learning, and derive and prove the PG expression for sOED. Adopting an actor-critic approach, we parameterize the policy and value functions using deep neural networks and improve them using gradient estimates produced from simulated episodes of designs and observations. The overall PG-sOED method is validated on a linear-Gaussian benchmark, and its advantages over batch and greedy designs are demonstrated through a contaminant source inversion problem in a convection-diffusion field.

42," For Bayesian optimization (BO) on high-dimensional data with complex structure, neural network-based kernels for Gaussian processes (GPs) have been used to learn flexible surrogate functions by the high representation power of deep learning. However, existing methods train neural networks by maximizing the marginal likelihood, which do not directly improve the BO performance. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for BO with neural network-based kernels that minimizes the expected gap between the true optimum value and the best value found by BO. We model a policy, which takes the current evaluated data points as input and outputs the next data point to be evaluated, by a neural network, where neural network-based kernels, GPs, and mutual information-based acquisition functions are used as its layers. With our model, the neural network-based kernel is trained to be appropriate for the acquisition function by backpropagating the gap through the acquisition function and GP. Our model is trained by a reinforcement learning framework from multiple tasks. Since the neural network is shared across different tasks, we can gather knowledge on BO from multiple training tasks, and use the knowledge for unseen test tasks. In experiments using three text document datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better BO performance than the existing methods. ",1

45,"The Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport (OT) theory, is a popular discrepancy measure between probability distributions with various applications to statistics and machine learning. Despite their rich structure and demonstrated utility, Wasserstein distances are sensitive to outliers in the considered distributions, which hinders applicability in practice. Inspired by the Huber contamination model, we propose a new outlier-robust Wasserstein distance Wεp which allows for ε outlier mass to be removed from each contaminated distribution. Our formulation amounts to a highly regular optimization problem that lends itself better for analysis compared to previously considered frameworks. Leveraging this, we conduct a thorough theoretical study of Wεp, encompassing characterization of optimal perturbations, regularity, duality, and statistical estimation and robustness results. In particular, by decoupling the optimization variables, we arrive at a simple dual form for Wεp that can be implemented via an elementary modification to standard, duality-based OT solvers. We illustrate the benefits of our framework via applications to generative modeling with contaminated datasets. ",1

48,"Neural networks in the lazy training regime converge to kernel machines. Can neural networks in the rich feature learning regime learn a kernel machine with a data-dependent kernel? We demonstrate that this can indeed happen due to a phenomenon we term silent alignment, which requires that the tangent kernel of a network evolves in eigenstructure while small and before the loss appreciably decreases, and grows only in overall scale afterwards. We show that such an effect takes place in homogenous neural networks with small initialization and whitened data. We provide an analytical treatment of this effect in the linear network case. In general, we find that the kernel develops a low-rank contribution in the early phase of training, and then evolves in overall scale, yielding a function equivalent to a kernel regression solution with the final network's tangent kernel. The early spectral learning of the kernel depends on both depth and on relative learning rates in each layer. We also demonstrate that non-whitened data can weaken the silent alignment effect. ",1

51,"Changepoint analysis deals with unsupervised detection and/or estimation of time-points in time-series data, when the distribution generating the data changes. In this article, we consider \emph{offline} changepoint detection in the context of large scale textual data.

As full likelihood based inference in this model is computationally intractable, we develop a computationally tractable approximate inference procedure. More specifically, we use sample splitting to estimate topic polytopes first and then apply a likelihood ratio statistic together with a modified version of the wild binary segmentation algorithm of Fryzlewicz et al. (2014). Our methodology facilitates automated detection of structural changes in large corpora without the need of manual processing by domain experts. As changepoints under our model correspond to changes in topic structure, the estimated changepoints are often highly interpretable as marking the surge or decline in popularity of a fashionable topic. We apply our procedure on two large datasets: (i) a corpus of English literature from the period 1800-1922 (Underwoodet al., 2015); (ii) abstracts from the High Energy Physics arXiv repository (Clementet al., 2019).

57,"Conjoint analysis is a popular experimental design used to measure multidimensional preferences. Researchers examine how varying a factor of interest, while controlling for other relevant factors, influences decision-making. Currently, there exist two methodological approaches to analyzing data from a conjoint experiment. The first focuses on estimating the average marginal effects of each factor while averaging over the other factors. Although this allows for straightforward design-based estimation, the results critically depend on the distribution of other factors and how interaction effects are aggregated. An alternative model-based approach can compute various quantities of interest, but requires researchers to correctly specify the model, a challenging task for conjoint analysis with many factors and possible interactions. In addition, a commonly used logistic regression has poor statistical properties even with a moderate number of factors when incorporating interactions. We propose a new hypothesis testing approach based on the conditional randomization test to answer the most fundamental question of conjoint analysis: Does a factor of interest matter in any way given the other factors? Our methodology is solely based on the randomization of factors, and hence is free from assumptions. Yet, it allows researchers to use any test statistic, including those based on complex machine learning algorithms. As a result, we are able to combine the strengths of the existing design-based and model-based approaches. We illustrate the proposed methodology through conjoint analysis of immigration preferences and political candidate evaluation. We also extend the proposed approach to test for regularity assumptions commonly used in conjoint analysis.",1

60,"We introduce a novel, probabilistic binary latent variable model to detect noisy or approximate repeats of patterns in sparse binary data. The model is based on the ""Noisy-OR model"" (Heckerman, 1990), used previously for disease and topic modelling. The model's capability is demonstrated by extracting structure in recordings from retinal neurons, but it can be widely applied to discover and model latent structure in noisy binary data. In the context of spiking neural data, the task is to ""explain"" spikes of individual neurons in terms of groups of neurons, ""Cell Assemblies"" (CAs), that often fire together, due to mutual interactions or other causes. The model infers sparse activity in a set of binary latent variables, each describing the activity of a cell assembly. When the latent variable of a cell assembly is active, it reduces the probabilities of neurons belonging to this assembly to be inactive. The conditional probability kernels of the latent components are learned from the data in an expectation maximization scheme, involving inference of latent states and parameter adjustments to the model. We thoroughly validate the model on synthesized spike trains constructed to statistically resemble recorded retinal responses to white noise stimulus and natural movie stimulus in data. We also apply our model to spiking responses recorded in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) during stimulation with a movie and discuss the found structure. ",1

For this reason, there is a growing interest about fairness and discrimination in the actuarial community Lindholm, Richman, Tsanakas, and Wuthrich (2022). Presumably, non-sensitive characteristics can serve as substitutes or proxies for protected attributes. For example, the color and model of a car, combined with the driver's occupation, may lead to an undesirable gender bias in the prediction of car insurance prices. Surprisingly, we will show that debiasing the predictor alone may be insufficient to maintain adequate accuracy (1). Indeed, the traditional pricing model is currently built in a two-stage structure that considers many potentially biased components such as car or geographic risks. We will show that this traditional structure has significant limitations in achieving fairness. For this reason, we have developed a novel pricing model approach. Recently some approaches have Blier-Wong, Cossette, Lamontagne, and Marceau (2021); Wuthrich and Merz (2021) shown the value of autoencoders in pricing. In this paper, we will show that (2) this can be generalized to multiple pricing factors (geographic, car type), (3) it perfectly adapted for a fairness context (since it allows to debias the set of pricing components): We extend this main idea to a general framework in which a single whole pricing model is trained by generating the geographic and car pricing components needed to predict the pure premium while mitigating the unwanted bias according to the desired metric.",1

68,"Bird Island is the most northern isle of the Seychelles' 115-island archipelago. It sits on the outer rim of the vast, undersea Mascarene Plateau, an extraordinary uplift of mid-ocean shallow water that covers an area larger than Portugal. The plateau begins at Bird Island and continues south for 2,000km, running almost the length of Madagascar. In the other direction, north of Bird, the Indian Ocean is deep, wide and uninterrupted by any landfall all the way to the Arabian Peninsula.",0
69,"In classical statistics, the bias-variance trade-off describes how varying a model's complexity (e.g., number of fit parameters) affects its ability to make accurate predictions. According to this trade-off, optimal performance is achieved when a model is expressive enough to capture trends in the data, yet not so complex that it overfits idiosyncratic features of the training data. Recently, it has become clear that this classic understanding of the bias-variance must be fundamentally revisited in light of the incredible predictive performance of ""overparameterized models"" -- models that avoid overfitting even when the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly fit the training data. Here, we present results for one of the simplest examples of an overparameterized model: regression with random linear features (i.e. a two-layer neural network with a linear activation function). Using the zero-temperature cavity method, we derive analytic expressions for the training error, test error, bias, and variance. We show that the linear random features model exhibits three phase transitions: two different transitions to an interpolation regime where the training error is zero, along with an additional transition between regimes with large bias and minimal bias. Using random matrix theory, we show how each transition arises due to small nonzero eigenvalues in the Hessian matrix. Finally, we compare and contrast the phase diagram of the random linear features model to the random nonlinear features model and ordinary regression, highlighting the new phase transitions that result from the use of linear basis functions.

72,"Conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) are versatile deep generative models that extend the standard VAE framework by conditioning the generative model with auxiliary covariates. The original CVAE model assumes that the data samples are independent, whereas more recent conditional VAE models, such as the Gaussian process (GP) prior VAEs, can account for complex correlation structures across all data samples. While several methods have been proposed to learn standard VAEs from partially observed datasets, these methods fall short for conditional VAEs. In this work, we propose a method to learn conditional VAEs from datasets in which auxiliary covariates can contain missing values as well. The proposed method augments the conditional VAEs with a prior distribution for the missing covariates and estimates their posterior using amortised variational inference. At training time, our method marginalises the uncertainty associated with the missing covariates while simultaneously maximising the evidence lower bound. We develop computationally efficient methods to learn CVAEs and GP prior VAEs that are compatible with mini-batching. Our experiments on simulated datasets as well as on a clinical trial study show that the proposed method outperforms previous methods in learning conditional VAEs from non-temporal, temporal, and longitudinal datasets.

75,"Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used in deep learning due to its computational efficiency but a complete understanding of why SGD performs so well remains a major challenge. It has been observed empirically that most eigenvalues of the Hessian of the loss functions on the loss landscape of over-parametrized deep networks are close to zero, while only a small number of eigenvalues are large. Zero eigenvalues indicate zero diffusion along the corresponding directions. This indicates that the process of minima selection mainly happens in the relatively low-dimensional subspace corresponding to top eigenvalues of the Hessian. Although the parameter space is very high-dimensional, these findings seems to indicate that the SGD dynamics may mainly live on a low-dimensional manifold. In this paper we pursue a truly data driven approach to the problem of getting a potentially deeper understanding of the high-dimensional parameter surface, and in particular of the landscape traced out by SGD, by analyzing the data generated through SGD, or any other optimizer for that matter, in order to possibly discovery (local) low-dimensional representations of the optimization landscape. As our vehicle for the exploration we use diffusion maps introduced by R. Coifman and coauthors.",1

78,"Convolutional neural network image classifiers are defined and the rate of convergence of the misclassification risk of the estimates towards the optimal misclassification risk is analyzed. Here we consider images as random variables with values in some functional space, where we only observe discrete samples as function values on some finite grid. Under suitable structural and smoothness assumptions on the functional a posteriori probability, which includes some kind of symmetry against rotation of subparts of the input image, it is shown that least squares plug-in classifiers based on convolutional neural networks are able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality in binary image classification if we neglect a resolution-dependent error term. The finite sample size behavior of the classifier is analyzed by applying it to simulated and real data.",1

81,"In many applications, data can be heterogeneous in the sense of spanning latent groups with different underlying distributions. When predictive models are applied to such data the heterogeneity can affect both predictive performance and interpretability. Building on developments at the intersection of unsupervised learning and regularised regression, we propose an approach for heterogeneous data that allows joint learning of (i) explicit multivariate feature distributions, (ii) high-dimensional regression models and (iii) latent group labels, with both (i) and (ii) specific to latent groups and both elements informing (iii). The approach is demonstrably effective in high dimensions, combining data reduction for computational efficiency with a re-weighting scheme that retains key signals even when the number of features is large. We discuss in detail these aspects and their impact on modelling and computation, including EM convergence. The approach is modular and allows incorporation of data reductions and high-dimensional estimators that are suitable for specific applications. We show results from extensive simulations and real data experiments, including highly non-Gaussian data. Our results allow efficient, effective analysis of high-dimensional data in settings, such as biomedicine, where both interpretable prediction and explicit feature space models are needed but hidden heterogeneity may be a concern.

84,"We pursue tractable Bayesian analysis of generalized linear models (GLMs) for categorical data. Thus far, GLMs are difficult to scale to more than a few dozen categories due to non-conjugacy or strong posterior dependencies when using conjugate auxiliary variable methods. We define a new class of GLMs for categorical data called categorical-from-binary (CB) models. Each CB model has a likelihood that is bounded by the product of binary likelihoods, suggesting a natural posterior approximation. This approximation makes inference straightforward and fast; using well-known auxiliary variables for probit or logistic regression, the product of binary models admits conjugate closed-form variational inference that is embarrassingly parallel across categories and invariant to category ordering. Moreover, an independent binary model simultaneously approximates multiple CB models. Bayesian model averaging over these can improve the quality of the approximation for any given dataset. We show that our approach scales to thousands of categories, outperforming posterior estimation competitors like Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) and No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) in the time required to achieve fixed prediction quality.

While critical concepts like fairness and explainability are often addressed, the safety of systems is typically not sufficiently taken into account. By viewing data-driven decision systems as socio-technical systems, we draw on the uncertainty in ML literature to show how fairML systems can also be safeML systems. We posit that a fair model needs to be an uncertainty-aware model, e.g. by drawing on distributional regression. For fair decisions, we argue that a safe fail option should be used for individuals with uncertain categorization. We introduce semi-structured deep distributional regression as a modeling framework which addresses multiple concerns brought against standard ML models and show its use in a real-world example of algorithmic profiling of job seekers.",1
